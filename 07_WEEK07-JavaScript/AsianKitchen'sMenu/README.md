## Key JavaScript Concepts

### Spread Operator with Map and Filter

The **spread operator** (`...`) in JavaScript allows an iterable (like an array or string) to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. It's particularly useful when working with array methods like `map` and `filter` to create new arrays without mutating the original data.
